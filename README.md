# Grav test
This is a test. I hope you can use this repo for use Grav with cloud service like Heroku, OpenShift, etc.

## Currently available on:

### Heroku
I've set up Heroku to use this repo, so just fork this repo and some setup on Heroku will make everything works. Take a look at https://mowl.herokuapp.com

### OpenShift
I don't know if OpenShift can works like Heroku, but I've test it and it works. The only different is on Heroku I don't pushed `vendor` folder but on OpenShift it's needed. I don't know why. Take a look at https://mowl-walutisme.rhcloud.com

### More will be added soon
I don't have much time for edit, test, error, check, and repeat it for cloud provider out there. But I will try my best.
