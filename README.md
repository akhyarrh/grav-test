# Grav test

I hope you can use this repo to use [Grav](https://github.com/getgrav/grav) with cloud service like Heroku, OpenShift, etc.

## Currently available on:

### Heroku
I've set up Heroku to use this repo, so just fork this repo and some setup on Heroku will make everything works. Take a look at https://mowl.herokuapp.com

### OpenShift (deprecated, site still online but not updated anymore)
On Heroku I don't pushed `vendor` folder but on OpenShift it needed. I don't know why. Take a look at https://mowl-walutisme.rhcloud.com

### More will be added soon
I don't have much time for edit, test, error, check, and repeat it on other cloud provider out there. If you've try Grav on another cloud service, PR are always welcome.
